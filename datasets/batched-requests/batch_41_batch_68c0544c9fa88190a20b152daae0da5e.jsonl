You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: KeypadDimmer.FanOff\nID: 70 12 D0 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: KeypadButton.BedsideL\nID: 70 12 D0 4\nParent: KeypadDimmer.FanOff [ID: 70 12 D0 1]\n  ***Properties***\n

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: KeypadButton.FanHi\nID: 70 12 D0 7\nParent: KeypadDimmer.FanOff [ID: 70 12 D0 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch.

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch.

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1.

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: OnOffModule.ShelfLights\nID: 36 73 3C 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: KeypadSwitch.Skylight.B\nID: 51 AC 51 4\nParent: KeypadSwitch.Skylight.On [ID: 51 AC 51 1]\n  ***Properties***\n

Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1.

Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: Dimmer.Ceiling.Lights\nID: 70 36 79 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: Dimmer.Ceiling.Lights\nID: 70 37 C0 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: 1F.29.6D.D\nID: 1F 29 6D 4\nParent: KeypadDimmer.FrontDoor [ID: 1F 29 6D 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway.

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: KeypadDimmer.Button.OCeiling\nID: 4D 32 B8 2\nParent: KeypadDimmer.Ceiling.Lights [ID: 4D 32 B8 1]\n

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: 4D.32.B8.E\nID: 4D 32 B8 5\nParent: KeypadDimmer.Ceiling.Lights [ID: 4D 32 B8 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: 4D.32.B8.H\nID: 4D 32 B8 8\nParent: KeypadDimmer.Ceiling.Lights [ID: 4D 32 B8 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: Dimmer.Closet.Lights\nID: 70 6 4B 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: Dimmer.Ceiling.Lights\nID: 70 6 48 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: 4D.34.1D.C\nID: 4D 34 1D 3\nParent: KeypadDimmer.CeilingFan.Off [ID: 4D 34 1D 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: 4D.34.1D.F\nID: 4D 34 1D 6\nParent: KeypadDimmer.CeilingFan.Off [ID: 4D 34 1D 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1.

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: Dimmer.Ceiling.Lights\nID: 20 91 DA 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom

You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n\\n## NuCore BASICS\\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\\n\\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\\n\\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\\n\\n## When to Act\\n\\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\\n\\n## Output Format (strict)\\n\\nReturn only:\\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n## CRITICAL Rules\\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\\n3. For multi-action requests (“both”, “all”, “this and that”), output separate fenced blocks—one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains “color”; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\\n\\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2–3 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\\n{\\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n1. Multi-device:\\nUser: “Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.”\\nOutput:\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n{\\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\\n  \"command_params\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \\n}\\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\\n\\n\\n2. Ambiguous device:\\nUser: “Turn on the hallway light.”\\nOutput:\\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light—upstairs or downstairs?\\n\\n3. Color with XY preference:\\nUser: “Make the color lamp warm pink.”\\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains “color” and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device’s range).\"},\n  {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\\n***Device***\nName: MicroDimmer.FloorLamp\nID: 70 AF 4A 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n    On Level [id=OL]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n    Ramp Rate [id=RR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        9.0 minutes [0]\n        8.0 minutes [1]\n        7.0 minutes [2]\n        6.0 minutes [3]\n        5.0 minutes [4]\n        4.5 minutes [5]\n        4.0 minutes [6]\n        3.5 minutes [7]\n        3.0 minutes [8]\n        2.5 minutes [9]\n        2.0 minutes [10]\n        1.5 minutes [11]\n        1.0 minute [12]\n        47.0 seconds [13]\n        43.0 seconds [14]\n        38.5 seconds [15]\n        34.0 seconds [16]\n        32.0 seconds [17]\n        30.0 seconds [18]\n        28.0 seconds [19]\n        26.0 seconds [20]\n        23.5 seconds [21]\n        21.5 seconds [22]\n        19.0 seconds [23]\n        8.5 seconds [24]\n        6.5 seconds [25]\n        4.5 seconds [26]\n        2.0 seconds [27]\n        0.5 seconds [28]\n        0.3 seconds [29]\n        0.2 seconds [30]\n        0.1 seconds [31]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Brighten [id=BRT]\n    Dim [id=DIM]\n    Fade Up [id=FDUP]\n    Fade Down [id=FDDOWN]\n    Fade Stop [id=FDSTOP]\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    On Level [id=OL]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n            Off [0]\n    Ramp Rate [id=RR]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=25]\n            9.0 minutes [0]\n            8.0 minutes [1]\n            7.0 minutes [2]\n            6.0 minutes [3]\n            5.0 minutes [4]\n            4.5 minutes [5]\n            4.0 minutes [6]\n            3.5 minutes [7]\n            3.0 minutes [8]\n            2.5 minutes [9]\n            2.0 minutes [10]\n            1.5 minutes [11]\n            1.0 minute [12]\n            47.0 seconds [13]\n            43.0 seconds [14]\n            38.5 seconds [15]\n            34.0 seconds [16]\n            32.0 seconds [17]\n            30.0 seconds [18]\n            28.0 seconds [19]\n            26.0 seconds [20]\n            23.5 seconds [21]\n            21.5 seconds [22]\n            19.0 seconds [23]\n            8.5 seconds [24]\n            6.5 seconds [25]\n            4.5 seconds [26]\n            2.0 seconds [27]\n            0.5 seconds [28]\n            0.3 seconds [29]\n            0.2 seconds [30]\n            0.1 seconds [31]\n    Backlight [id=BL]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fade Up [id=FDUP]\n    Fade Down [id=FDDOWN]\n    Fade Stop [id=FDSTOP]\n    Brighten [id=BRT]\n    Dim [id=DIM]\\n\\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>\"},\n  {\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>\"}\n]}\n\nNow, analyze the content in system role above and DEVICE STRUCTURE in the user role above and generate a minimum of 3 samples: \nFor each sample:\n1.
