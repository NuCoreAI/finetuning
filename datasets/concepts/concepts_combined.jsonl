This command does not take brightness or transition time parameters, so to set brightness and transition time simultaneously, we need to use other commands.\n\nBrightness can be set using Set Brightness [SET_BRI] with a value from 1 to 254; 200 is valid.\n\nTransition time can be set using Set Transition Time [RR] with a range from 0 to 540000 ms; 30000 ms is valid.\n\nFor color with brightness and transition, the best approach is to use Set HSB Color [SET_HSB], which accepts Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and Transition Time. However, since you want Royal Blue, which is an enum color, we can first set the color using SET_COLOR with Royal Blue, then adjust brightness and transition time separately.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a smooth transition, we can use SET_HSB with the hue and saturation values corresponding to Royal Blue. Since the exact hue and saturation for Royal Blue are not given, we rely on the enum SET_COLOR command.\n\nFinally, to make the spotlight breathe slowly as an alert, use Set Alert [SET_ALERT] with Breathe [2].\n\nSteps:\n1.

The Heat Setpoint property ranges from 0 to 120 degrees and can be adjusted using the Heat Setpoint command with a parameter in that range. However, there are also Setpoint Up and Setpoint Down commands which likely adjust the setpoint incrementally. Since the user wants to increase the heat setpoint by 5 degrees, the best approach is to use the Heat Setpoint command with the current heat setpoint plus 5, but since the current value is not provided, the safest is to use Setpoint Up command 5 times if each step corresponds to 1 degree, or directly set Heat Setpoint if the current value is known. The fan mode can be set using the Fan Mode command with parameter 'Auto' which corresponds to enum value 8.\n\nSince the current heat setpoint is unknown, the assistant should recommend using the Heat Setpoint command with the desired value if known, or use Setpoint Up command 5 times if incremental steps are 1 degree.

The 'On Level' property controls brightness from 0 to 100%, so setting it to 75% means using the On Level command with parameter 75. For fading up slowly, the device supports the 'Fade Up' command, which initiates a gradual increase in brightness. The ramp rate property defines how fast the brightness changes, but since you want a slow fade, we should ensure the ramp rate is set to a longer duration before fading up. The longest ramp rate available is 9.0 minutes [0].\n\nStep 1: Set the Ramp Rate to 9.0 minutes using the Ramp Rate command with parameter 0.\nStep 2: Set the On Level to 75% using the On Level command with parameter 75.\nStep 3: Issue the Fade Up command to start the slow fade.\n\nResult: Set Ramp Rate to 9.0 minutes, then set On Level to 75%, and finally send Fade Up command to the kitchen ceiling light."}]}
