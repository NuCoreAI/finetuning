The user wants to set the fan speed to high and know the remaining filter life percentage.\n\nFrom the device structure, the fan speed property accepts three enum values: Low [1], Medium [2], and High [3]. The accepted command to change fan speed is setFanSpeed with an enum parameter.\n\nTo set the fan speed to high, I will use setFanSpeed with the parameter 'High'.\n\nNext, the filter life remaining is a float property ranging from 0.0 to 100.0 percent. To get this value, I can use the queryStatus command or the reportFilterStatus send command.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n1. Execute setFanSpeed(speed=High) to set the fan speed.\n2. Execute queryStatus() or reportFilterStatus() to retrieve the current filter life remaining.\n\nResult: Set fan speed to High using setFanSpeed(High), then query filter life remaining to inform the user of the current percentage."}]}
