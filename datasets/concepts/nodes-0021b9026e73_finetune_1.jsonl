The Ramp Rate property controls the speed of brightness changes, with 5.0 minutes corresponding to enum value [4]. The Fade Up command can be used to gradually increase brightness.\n\nTo set the lights to 50% brightness and fade up slowly over 5 minutes, first set the ramp rate to 5.0 minutes using the Ramp Rate command with parameter 4. Then, use the On Level command with parameter 50 to set brightness. Finally, issue the Fade Up command to start the gradual increase.\n\nResult: Send RR(4) to set ramp rate to 5 minutes, OL(50) to set brightness to 50%, and FDUP to begin fading up slowly."}]}
