{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user’s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands — id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nReturn only:\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\nA single clarifying question prefixed with CLARIFY: (no commands)\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\n3. For multi-action requests (\u201cboth\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201cthis and that\u201d), output separate fenced blocks\u2014one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains \u201ccolor\u201d; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u20133 choices.\n3. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Multi-device:\nUser: \u201cTurn on porch and set hallway to 20%.\u201d\nOutput:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n\n2. Ambiguous device:\nUser: \u201cTurn on the hallway light.\u201d\nOutput:\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light\u2014upstairs or downstairs?\n\n3. Color with XY preference:\nUser: \u201cMake the color lamp warm pink.\u201d\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains \u201ccolor\u201d and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device\u2019s range)."}],"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZY 189 Multilevel Sensor\nID: ZY189_118\nParent: GAR0-SENSOR_02-ZY189 [ID: ZY189_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Temperature [id=CLITEMP]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: HALL-FAN SW_ZM 010.1\nID: ZM00010_001_1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=78]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n        Unknown [101]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=51]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Toggle [id=TOGGLE]\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: ZY 189 Wake Up\nID: ZY189_199\nParent: GAR0-SENSOR_02-ZY189 [ID: ZY189_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Is Awake [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        False [0]\n        True [100]\n        Unknown [101]\n    Keep Awake [id=GV1]\n      Enum [uom id=78]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Wake Interval [id=GV2]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Keep Awake [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=78]\n            Off [0]\n            On [100]\n    Keep Awake Off [id=DOF]\n    Set Wake Interval [id=SETIV]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 4660 Unit Hours [uom id=20]\n          Range 0 to 279620 Unit Minutes [uom id=45]\n          Range 0 to 16777215 Unit seconds [uom id=58]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Keep Awake [id=DON]\n    Keep Awake Off [id=DOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: Toggle the hall fan and then turn it off."},{"role":"assistant","content":"__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZM00010_001_1\",\n  \"command_id\": \"TOGGLE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The user wants to toggle the hall fan, so we use the TOGGLE command for the HALL-FAN SW_ZM 010.1 device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZM00010_001_1\",\n  \"command_id\": \"DOF\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The user wants to turn off the hall fan after toggling it, so we use the DOF command for the same device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__"}
