The user wants the Den Lamp to turn on to 75% brightness.\n2. The trigger is a physical turn on of the Hall-End I3 Paddle, which is a COC event (command sent by device).\n3. The Hall-End I3 Paddle sends a Fast On (DFON) command when physically turned on.\n4. The action is to send the On command (DON) to Den Lamp with parameter 75% (On Level).\n\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"name\": \"Turn on Den Lamp when Hall-End I3 Paddle physically turned on\",\n    \"condition\": {\n      \"==\": {\n        \"device\": \"Hall-End I3 Paddle\",\n        \"coc\": \"DFON\",\n        \"parameters\": []\n      }\n    },\n    \"action\": {\n      \"device\": \"Den Lamp\",\n      \"command\": \"On\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        { \"name\": \"On Level\", \"value\": 75, \"uom\": \"percent\", \"precision\": 1 }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}"}]}
