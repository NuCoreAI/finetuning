{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You can provide live property values for devices define in DEVICE STRUCTURE. \n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \t6 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nWhen the user asks for Live (**real-time**) Property or Status Request (e.g., \u001cIs the light on?\u001d or \u001cWhat\u001cs the current temperature?\u001d or \"waht is cool temp\" or \"how many miles can I drive\" or \"what's my range\")\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nFor **each** requested live property/status, emit the following structure (property block) \n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"property_id\": \"<PROPERTY_ID>\",\n  \"property_name\": \"<PROPERTY_NAME>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n2. Use the exact property_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For multi-properties requests (\u001cboth\u001d, \u001call\u001d, \u001cthis and that\u001d), output separate fenced blocks\u001fone per property. Do not merge properties.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If a required property_id is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n3. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u00133 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ratgdov25i-4a1a79-Door\nID: n018_eh9834cfaf_dr\nParent: ratgdov25i-4a1a79 [ID: n018_eh9834cfaf]\n  ***Properties***\n    Door State [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Closed [0]\n        Open [1]\n        Stopped [2]\n        Closing [3]\n        Opening [4]\n        Unknown [9]\n        Unknown [9]\n    Obstruction [id=GV1]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Clear [0]\n        Obstructed [1]\n        Unknown [101]\n        Unknown [101]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Open [id=DON]\n    Close [id=DOF]\n    Stop [id=STOP]\n    Toggle [id=TOGGLE]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Open [id=DON]\n    Close [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ratgdov25i-4a1a79-Light\nID: n018_eh9834cfaf_lt\nParent: ratgdov25i-4a1a79 [ID: n018_eh9834cfaf]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ratgdov25i-4a1a79-Motion\nID: n018_eh9834cfaf_mo\nParent: ratgdov25i-4a1a79 [ID: n018_eh9834cfaf]\n  ***Properties***\n    Motion [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Clear [0]\n        Detected [1]\n        Unknown [101]\n        Unknown [101]\n    Last Detected [id=GV3]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Motion Detected [id=DON]\n\nUSER QUERY: Is the door open and is there any motion detected right now?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n018_eh9834cfaf_dr\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Door State\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User asked if the door is open, so the door state property is needed to determine if it is open.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n018_eh9834cfaf_mo\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Motion\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User asked if there is any motion detected right now, so the motion property is needed.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__"}]}
