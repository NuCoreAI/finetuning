{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You can provide live property values for devices define in DEVICE STRUCTURE. \n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nWhen the user asks for Live (**real-time**) Property or Status Request (e.g., \u00147Is the light on?\u00148 or \u00147What\u0019s the current temperature?\u00148 or \"waht is cool temp\" or \"how many miles can I drive\" or \"what's my range\")\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nFor **each** requested live property/status, emit the following structure (property block) \n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"property_id\": \"<PROPERTY_ID>\",\n  \"property_name\": \"<PROPERTY_NAME>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n2. Use the exact property_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For multi-properties requests (\u00147both\u00148, \u00147all\u00148, \u00147this and that\u00148), output separate fenced blocks\u00151one per property. Do not merge properties.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If a required property_id is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n3. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u00133 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: Front Door (Motion)\nID: n006_272637780_m\nParent: Ring [ID: n006_controller]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Motion [id=DON]***Device***\nName: Party Cam (Motion)\nID: n006_306491825_m\nParent: Ring [ID: n006_controller]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Offline [0]\n        Online [1]\n    Battery life [id=BATLVL]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n    Battery life 2 [id=GV0]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n    Battery mV [id=GV1]\n      Range 0 to 20000 Unit Millivolt [uom id=43] (step of 10 and precision of 1).\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Motion [id=DON]***Device***\nName: Sun Position\nID: n008_sunctrl\n  ***Properties***\n    NodeServer Online [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Disconnected [0]\n        Connected [1]\n        Failed [2]\n    Azimuth [id=GV0]\n      Range -360 to 360 Unit Degrees [uom id=14]\n    Elevation [id=GV1]\n      Range -360 to 360 Unit Degrees [uom id=14]\n    Zenith [id=GV2]\n      Range -360 to 360 Unit Degrees [uom id=14]\n    Moon Phase [id=GV3]\n      Range 0 to 27.99 Unit Raw [uom id=56]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: What is the battery level and status of the Party Cam, and also what is the current azimuth of the sun?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n006_306491825_m\",\n  \"property_id\": \"BATLVL\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Battery life\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User requested the battery level of the Party Cam device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n006_306491825_m\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Status\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User requested the current status (online/offline) of the Party Cam device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n008_sunctrl\",\n  \"property_id\": \"GV0\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Azimuth\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User asked for the current azimuth of the sun from the Sun Position device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__"}]}
