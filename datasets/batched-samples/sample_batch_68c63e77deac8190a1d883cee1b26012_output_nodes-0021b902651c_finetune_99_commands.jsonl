{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nReturn only:\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\n3. For multi-action requests (\u00147oth\u00148, \u0014all\u00148, \u0014this and that\u00148), output separate fenced blocks\u00151one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains \u0014color\u00148; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2\u00133 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Multi-device:\nUser: \u0014Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.\u0014\nOutput:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n\n2. Ambiguous device:\nUser: \u0014Turn on the hallway light.\u0014\nOutput:\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light\u00151stairs or downstairs?\n\n3. Color with XY preference:\nUser: \u0014Make the color lamp warm pink.\u0014\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains \u0014color\u0014 and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device\u0019s range)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: AudioPlayer\nID: n015_0\n  ***Properties***\n    Playing Status [id=ST]\n      Range 0 to 1 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n        Idle [0]\n        Playing [1]\n    Playing [id=GV0]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n        None [0]\n        computer.mp3 [1]\n        chimes.mp3 [2]\n        schime.mp3 [3]\n        rbell.mp3 [4]\n        wind.mp3 [5]\n        bells2.mp3 [6]\n        mystical.mp3 [7]\n        magic.mp3 [8]\n        harp.mp3 [9]\n        hbell.mp3 [10]\n        fragment.mp3 [11]\n        wchime.mp3 [12]\n        synth.mp3 [13]\n        pa.mp3 [14]\n        bells.mp3 [15]\n        fantasy.mp3 [16]\n        malonc.mp3 [17]\n        example.mp3 [18]\n        chime.mp3 [19]\n    Bluetooth [id=GV1]\n      Range 0 to 1 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n        Disabled [0]\n        Enabled [1]\n    Output [id=GV2]\n      Range 0 to 1 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n        Speaker Jack [0]\n        Bluetooth [1]\n    Volume [id=GV3]\n      Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Play [id=PLAY]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n            None [0]\n            computer.mp3 [1]\n            chimes.mp3 [2]\n            schime.mp3 [3]\n            rbell.mp3 [4]\n            wind.mp3 [5]\n            bells2.mp3 [6]\n            mystical.mp3 [7]\n            magic.mp3 [8]\n            harp.mp3 [9]\n            hbell.mp3 [10]\n            fragment.mp3 [11]\n            wchime.mp3 [12]\n            synth.mp3 [13]\n            pa.mp3 [14]\n            bells.mp3 [15]\n            fantasy.mp3 [16]\n            malonc.mp3 [17]\n            example.mp3 [18]\n            chime.mp3 [19]\n    Stop [id=STOP]\n    Output [id=OUTPUT]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 1 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n            Speaker Jack [0]\n            Bluetooth [1]\n    Volume [id=VOLUME]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n    Remove [id=REMOVE]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit Index [uom id=25]\n            None [0]\n            computer.mp3 [1]\n            chimes.mp3 [2]\n            schime.mp3 [3]\n            rbell.mp3 [4]\n            wind.mp3 [5]\n            bells2.mp3 [6]\n            mystical.mp3 [7]\n            magic.mp3 [8]\n            harp.mp3 [9]\n            hbell.mp3 [10]\n            fragment.mp3 [11]\n            wchime.mp3 [12]\n            synth.mp3 [13]\n            pa.mp3 [14]\n            bells.mp3 [15]\n            fantasy.mp3 [16]\n            malonc.mp3 [17]\n            example.mp3 [18]\n            chime.mp3 [19]***Device***\nName: USW Pro Max - 24 Port Switch\nID: n007_dc6279a2eff104\nParent: SmartStrip DC6279A2EFF1 [ID: n007_dc6279a2eff1]***Device***\nName: Plug 5\nID: n007_dc6279a2eff105\nParent: SmartStrip DC6279A2EFF1 [ID: n007_dc6279a2eff1]\n\nUSER QUERY: Play the chimes.mp3 and set the volume to 75% on the audio player."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n015_0\",\n  \"command_id\": \"PLAY\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"n/a\", \"value\": 2, \"uom\": \"25\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"The user wants to play chimes.mp3 on the audio player, which corresponds to value 2 in the PLAY command parameter.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"n015_0\",\n  \"command_id\": \"VOLUME\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"n/a\", \"value\": 75, \"uom\": \"51\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"The user wants to set the volume to 75% on the audio player, so we use the VOLUME command with value 75 and uom 51 for percent.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__"}]}
