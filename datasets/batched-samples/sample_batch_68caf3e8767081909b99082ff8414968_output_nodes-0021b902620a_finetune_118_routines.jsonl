{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: channel_2\nID: n015_300336_2\nParent: 1602-Vue-Main [ID: n015_300336]\n  ***Properties***\n    Killowatts [id=CPW]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit Kilowatts [uom id=30]\n    Hourly KWh [id=GV1]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Daily KWh [id=GV2]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Monthly KWh [id=GV3]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: channel_3\nID: n015_300336_3\nParent: 1602-Vue-Main [ID: n015_300336]\n  ***Properties***\n    Killowatts [id=CPW]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit Kilowatts [uom id=30]\n    Hourly KWh [id=GV1]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Daily KWh [id=GV2]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Monthly KWh [id=GV3]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: channel_4\nID: n015_300336_4\nParent: 1602-Vue-Main [ID: n015_300336]\n  ***Properties***\n    Killowatts [id=CPW]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit Kilowatts [uom id=30]\n    Hourly KWh [id=GV1]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Daily KWh [id=GV2]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n    Monthly KWh [id=GV3]\n      Range -100000 to 100000 Unit kWh [uom id=33]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n\nUSER QUERY: When channel_2's instantaneous power (Killowatts) jumps above 50.00 kW after sunset, or when I manually trigger Query on channel_2, poll channel_3 and channel_4 immediately to capture their metrics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"id\": 101,\n    \"name\": \"Query channel_3 and channel_4 when channel_2 power spike after sunset or manual query\",\n    \"parent\": 0,\n    \"comment\": \"Poll other channels when channel_2 CPW >= 5000 (precision 2 => 50.00) after sunset or when channel_2 Query control is invoked\",\n    \"if\": [\n      { \"(\": 1 },\n        { \">=\": { \"device\": \"n015_300336_2\", \"status\": \"ST\", \"value\": 5000, \"uom\": \"30\", \"precision\": 2 } },\n        { \"and\": 1 },\n        { \"at\": { \"sunset\": 0 } },\n      { \")\": 1 },\n      { \"or\": 1 },\n      { \"==\": { \"device\": \"n015_300336_2\", \"control\": \"QUERY\" } }\n    ],\n    \"then\": [\n      { \"device\": \"n015_300336_3\", \"command\": \"Query\", \"parameters\": [] },\n      { \"device\": \"n015_300336_4\", \"command\": \"Query\", \"parameters\": [] }\n    ],\n    \"else\": [],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Trigger when channel_2 has a COS with CPW >= 50.00 kW after sunset, or when the user issues a COC (manual Query) on channel_2.
