{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore commands based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nIf the user wants to control a device, consult Accepts Commands for that device and return one or more command blocks.\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nReturn only:\nOne or more fenced NuCore command blocks (no prose between blocks), or\nCommand block (no extra fields, no trailing commas):\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"command_id\": \"<COMMAND_ID>\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"<PARAM_ID>\",\n      \"value\": <VALUE>,\n      \"uom\": \"<UOM_ID>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. command_id must exactly match (case-sensitive) one listed in Accepts Commands for the chosen device.\n2. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For uom, use the uom_id\n3. For multi-action requests (\u00147oth\u00148, \u0014all\u00148, \u0014this and that\u00148), output separate fenced blocks\u00151one per action/device. Do not merge actions.\n4. Do not control cars unless the user explicitly says so.\n5. For color requests, first select devices whose name contains \u0014color\u00148; then prefer a command that accepts XY parameters if present.\n6. Only include parameters actually defined for the chosen command_id. If a command has no parameters, omit command_params entirely.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output command blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If a required parameter (e.g., level, setpoint) is missing and no safe default is defined, or if multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY question naming the top 2\u00133 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Multi-device:\nUser: \u0014Turn on porch and set hallway to 20%.\u0014\nOutput:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"porch.light.1\",\n  \"command_id\": \"DON\",\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to turn on the portch. So, we use the DON command\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"hallway.dim.2\",\n  \"command_id\": \"SET\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"level\", \"value\": 20, \"uom\": \"104\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\" : \"The user wants to set the dim level to 20% for hallway. We use the uom id for %\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\n\n2. Ambiguous device:\nUser: \u0014Turn on the hallway light.\u0014\nOutput:\nCLARIFY: Which hallway light\u00151stairs or downstairs?\n\n3. Color with XY preference:\nUser: \u0014Make the color lamp warm pink.\u0014\nOutput: (choose the device whose name contains \u0014color\u0014 and a command with XY if available; map pink to plausible XY within device\u0019s range)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZY 027 Switch All\nID: ZY027_183\nParent: Deck Lighting Transfrmr ZY27 [ID: ZY027_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Ignore All On & All Off [0]\n        Ignore All On [1]\n        Ignore All Off [2]\n        Ignore None [255]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    All On [id=ALLON]\n    All Off [id=ALLOFF]\n    Options [id=ALLSET]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=25]\n            Ignore All On & All Off [0]\n            Ignore All On [1]\n            Ignore All Off [2]\n            Ignore None [255]\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: ZY 027 SC Basic Assoc 2\nID: ZY027_252N002\nParent: Deck Lighting Transfrmr ZY27 [ID: ZY027_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ZY 027 SC Basic Assoc 3\nID: ZY027_252N003\nParent: Deck Lighting Transfrmr ZY27 [ID: ZY027_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "User Query: \"Turn on all the deck lights and then turn off the second switch.\"\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY027_183\",\n  \"command_id\": \"ALLON\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User wants to turn on all deck lights, so we use the All On command for the switch all device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY027_252N002\",\n  \"command_id\": \"DOF\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User wants to turn off the second switch, which corresponds to ZY027_252N002 device.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\nUser Query: \"Please ignore all on and all off commands on the main switch.\"\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY027_183\",\n  \"command_id\": \"ALLSET\",\n  \"command_params\": [\n    {\"id\": \"n/a\", \"value\": 0, \"uom\": \"25\"}\n  ],\n  \"reasoning\": \"User wants to set the main switch to ignore all on and all off commands, so we use the Options command with the enum value 0.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND__\n\nUser Query: \"Turn on the basic switch but I didn't specify which one.\"\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"Which basic switch do you want to turn on: ZY 027 SC Basic Assoc 2 or ZY 027 SC Basic Assoc 3?\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User request is ambiguous between two basic switches that both accept the DON command.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_COMMAND_CLARIFY__"}]}
