{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZY 028 SC Basic Control\nID: ZY028_251\nParent: Deck Outdoor Transformer ZY28 [ID: ZY028_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: Old Garage MultiSensor ZY31 M\nID: ZY031_1\n  ***Properties***\n    Temperature [id=CLITEMP]\n    Luminance [id=LUMIN]\n    UV Light [id=UV]\n    Battery Level [id=BATLVL]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Set Configuration [id=CONFIG]\n        Parameter 1: name=Parameter Number [id=NUM]\n        Parameter 2: name=Parameter Value [id=VAL]\n          Range 0 to 255 Unit 1 Byte (Unsigned) [uom id=107]\n          Range 0 to 65535 Unit 2 Bytes (Unsigned) [uom id=108]\n          Range 0 to 4294967295 Unit 4 Bytes (Unsigned) [uom id=110]\n          Range -128 to 127 Unit 1 Byte [uom id=111]\n          Range -32768 to 32767 Unit 2 Byte [uom id=112]\n          Range -2147483648 to 214748647 Unit 4 Byte [uom id=114]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]***Device***\nName: Garage MultiSensor ZY31 Weath\nID: ZY031_373\nParent: Old Garage MultiSensor ZY31 M [ID: ZY031_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Humidity [id=CLIHUM]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n\nUSER QUERY: When the deck transformer (ZY028_251) is turned on manually (the hardware sends DON) during evenings (19:00\u201322:00 daily), if the Old Garage sensor reports Responding = False, set parameter number 5 to value 1 (1 byte unsigned) on the Old Garage Multisensor and write changes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"id\": 101,\n    \"name\": \"Deck manual ON during evening: fix garage sensor responding\",\n    \"parent\": 0,\n    \"comment\": \"When deck transformer is turned on manually in the evening and the garage sensor is not responding, set config parameter and commit.\",\n    \"if\": [\n      { \"==\": { \"device\": \"ZY028_251\", \"control\": \"DON\" } },\n      { \"and\": 1 },\n      { \"weekly\": { \"days\": \"sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat\", \"from\": { \"time\": \"19:00\", \"to\": { \"time\": \"22:00\" } } } },\n      { \"and\": 1 },\n      { \"==\": { \"device\": \"ZY031_1\", \"status\": \"ERR\", \"value\": 1, \"uom\": \"25\", \"precision\": 0 } }\n    ],\n    \"then\": [\n      { \"device\": \"ZY031_1\", \"command\": \"CONFIG\", \"parameters\": [ { \"name\": \"NUM\", \"value\": 5 }, { \"name\": \"VAL\", \"value\": 1, \"uom\": \"107\", \"precision\": 0 } ] },\n      { \"device\": \"ZY031_1\", \"command\": \"WDU\", \"parameters\": [] }\n    ],\n    \"else\": [],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Trigger on physical ON (DON) of the deck transformer during evening hours.
