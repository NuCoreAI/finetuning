You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: IR Button N\nID: n009_irbutton_111\nParent: eISY IR Controller [ID: n009_controller]\n  ***Properties***\n    State [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Idle [0]\n        Pressed [1]\n        Held [2]\n        Released [3]\n        Offline [4]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Pressed [id=GV1]\n    Held [id=GV2]\n    Released [id=GV3]***Device***\nName: IR Button O\nID: n009_irbutton_112\nParent: eISY IR Controller [ID: n009_controller]\n  ***Properties***\n    State [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Idle [0]\n        Pressed [1]\n        Held [2]\n        Released [3]\n        Offline [4]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Pressed [id=GV1]\n    Held [id=GV2]\n    Released [id=GV3]***Device***\nName: IR Button Up\nID: n009_irbutton_152\nParent: eISY IR Controller [ID: n009_controller]\n  ***Properties***\n    State [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Idle [0]\n        Pressed [1]\n        Held [2]\n        Released [3]\n        Offline [4]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Pressed [id=GV1]\n    Held [id=GV2]\n    Released [id=GV3]\n\nUSER QUERY: Run a routine when either IR Button N or IR Button O is pressed on weekdays between 08:00 and 18:00."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"id\": 101,\n    \"name\": \"Weekday press: IR Button N or O 08-18\",\n    \"parent\": 0,\n    \"comment\": \"Trigger on human press of N or O during weekday business hours\",\n    \"if\": [\n      { \"(\": 1 },\n        { \"==\": { \"device\": \"n009_irbutton_111\", \"control\": \"Pressed\" } },\n        { \"or\": 1 },\n        { \"==\": { \"device\": \"n009_irbutton_112\", \"control\": \"Pressed\" } },\n      { \")\": 1 },\n      { \"and\": 1 },\n      { \"weekly\": { \"days\": \"mon,tue,wed,thu,fri\", \"from\": { \"time\": \"08:00\", \"to\": { \"time\": \"18:00\" } } } }\n    ],\n    \"then\": [],\n    \"else\": [],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Use COC detections for 'Pressed' from either IR Button N or O and restrict to weekdays between 08:00 and 18:00 with a weekly schedule.
