{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\nReturn only: One or more fenced NuCore routine blocks between __BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__ and __END_NUCORE_ROUTINE__. Follow the schema exactly. \"parent\" required. \"if\" is a flat ordered array of tokens. \"then\"/\"else\" are arrays of actions. Provide reasoning inside the routine schema. If ambiguous, return a CLARIFY block.\n\n**Condition Tokens** include COS, COC, Schedules (at, sunrise, sunset, from, weekly), logical operators (and, or, parentheses), and math operators. Use exact token syntax shown in the platform documentation.\n\n**Actions** use device IDs from DEVICE STRUCTURE and commands that appear in the device's accepts list. Use parameter names and UOM ids exactly as defined.\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n- Provide reasoning inside the routine schema.\n- Do not invent IDs, parameter names, uom ids, or values not present in the DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n- Keep output minimal and structured."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: Water Heater Outlet\nID: 46 BF B1 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=51]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Backlight [id=BL]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fade Up [id=FDUP]\n    Fade Down [id=FDDOWN]\n    Fade Stop [id=FDSTOP]\n***Device***\nName: Water Heater Pump\nID: 46 BF B1 2\nParent: Water Heater Outlet [ID: 46 BF B1 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=51]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Backlight [id=BL]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 100 Unit % [uom id=51]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fade Up [id=FDUP]\n    Fade Down [id=FDDOWN]\n    Fade Stop [id=FDSTOP]\n***Device***\nName: Setup PW Parameters\nID: n003_setup_2662707\nParent: Tesla Powerwall Master [ID: n003_2662707]\n\nUSER QUERY: When the Water Heater Outlet turns ON during weekdays between 06:00 and 08:00, start the Water Heater Pump automatically.
