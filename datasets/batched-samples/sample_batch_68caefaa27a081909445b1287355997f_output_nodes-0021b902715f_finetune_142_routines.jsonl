{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: MC MS Wake Up\nID: ZY028_199\nParent: MC MS Home Security Alarm [ID: ZY028_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Is Awake [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        False [0]\n        True [100]\n        Unknown [101]\n    Keep Awake [id=GV1]\n      Enum [uom id=78]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Wake Interval [id=GV2]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Keep Awake [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=78]\n            Off [0]\n            On [100]\n    Keep Awake Off [id=DOF]\n    Set Wake Interval [id=SETIV]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Range 0 to 4660 Unit Hours [uom id=20]\n          Range 0 to 279620 Unit Minutes [uom id=45]\n          Range 0 to 16777215 Unit seconds [uom id=58]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    Keep Awake [id=DON]\n    Keep Awake Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ZY 028 SC Basic Assoc 2\nID: ZY028_252N002\nParent: MC MS Home Security Alarm [ID: ZY028_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ZY 028 SC Basic Assoc 3\nID: ZY028_252N003\nParent: MC MS Home Security Alarm [ID: ZY028_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: When the associated sensor ZY 028 SC Basic Assoc 2 is turned on between 06:00 and 08:00 on weekdays, enable Keep Awake on MC MS Wake Up."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"id\": 101,\n    \"name\": \"Enable Keep Awake when assoc sensor turns on during weekday mornings\",\n    \"parent\": 0,\n    \"comment\": \"When ZY028_252N002 sends On between 06:00-08:00 Mon-Fri, enable Keep Awake On\",\n    \"if\": [\n      { \"==\": { \"device\":\"ZY028_252N002\",\"control\":\"DON\" } },\n      { \"and\": 1 },\n      { \"weekly\": { \"days\":\"mon,tue,wed,thu,fri\",\"from\":{ \"time\":\"06:00\",\"to\":{ \"time\":\"08:00\" } } } }\n    ],\n    \"then\": [\n      { \"device\":\"ZY028_199\",\"command\":\"DON\",\"parameters\":[{ \"name\":\"n/a\",\"value\":100,\"uom\":\"78\",\"precision\":0 }] }\n    ],\n    \"else\": [],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Use the assoc sensor COC (On) during the weekday morning window to proactively enable Keep Awake on the MC MS Wake Up device.
