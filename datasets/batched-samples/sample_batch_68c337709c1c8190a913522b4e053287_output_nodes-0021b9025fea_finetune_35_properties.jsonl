{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You can provide live property values for devices define in DEVICE STRUCTURE. \n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \t6 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nWhen the user asks for Live (**real-time**) Property or Status Request (e.g., \u00199Is the light on?\u001a or \u00199What\u001as the current temperature?\u001a or \"waht is cool temp\" or \"how many miles can I drive\" or \"what's my range\")\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nFor **each** requested live property/status, emit the following structure (property block) \n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"property_id\": \"<PROPERTY_ID>\",\n  \"property_name\": \"<PROPERTY_NAME>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n2. Use the exact property_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For multi-properties requests (\u0019both\u001a, \u0019all\u001a, \u0019this and that\u001a), output separate fenced blocks\t6 one per property. Do not merge properties.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If a required property_id is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n3. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u00133 choices. Use the following structure for CLARIFY:\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"The requested clarification content and question\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_CLARIFY__\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: 25.18.A2 - Heat Ctl\nID: 25 18 A2 3\nParent: 25.18.A2 - Main [ID: 25 18 A2 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: Onkyo Controller\nID: n002_controller\n  ***Properties***\n    NodeServer Online [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        Disconnected [0]\n        Connected [1]\n        Failed [2]***Device***\nName: Rachio Bridge\nID: n003_controller\n  ***Properties***\n    Node Server Connected [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=2]\n        False [0]\n        True [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Discover [id=DISCOVER]\n    Query All Devices [id=QUERY]\n\nUSER QUERY: Is the heat control on and responding properly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"25 18 A2 3\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Status\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User asked if the heat control is on, so the Status property indicates if it is On or Off.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"25 18 A2 3\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ERR\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Responding\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User also asked if the heat control is responding properly, so the Responding property shows if it is True or False.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__"}]}
