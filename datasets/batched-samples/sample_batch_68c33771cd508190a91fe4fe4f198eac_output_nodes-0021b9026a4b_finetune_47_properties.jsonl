Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1.
