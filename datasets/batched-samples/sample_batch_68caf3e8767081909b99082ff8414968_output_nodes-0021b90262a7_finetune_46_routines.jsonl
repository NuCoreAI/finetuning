You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZM 002.11 Main\nID: ZM00002_011_1\n  ***Properties***\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]***Device***\nName: Living Room Patio Door\nID: 2D 72 81 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]***Device***\nName: Living Room Patio Door-Closed\nID: 2D 72 81 2\nParent: Living Room Patio Door [ID: 2D 72 81 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: After hours alert: When the Living Room Patio Door opens (status changes to On) OR someone physically fast\u2011turns on the Patio Door-Closed sensor (DFON), but only overnight (22:00\u201306:00), query the main ZM module and write changes to the closed sensor.
