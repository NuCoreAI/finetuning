You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u2014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u2192 ON, Closed \u2192 Open, 72\u00b0F \u2192 73\u00b0F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: Toyota HQ\nID: n005_occ2geo02***Device***\nName: DCS\nID: n005_occ2geo03***Device***\nName: Valent\nID: n005_occ2geo04\n\nUSER QUERY: When DCS changes to ALARM (a COS) or when I double-tap Toyota HQ's physical control (a COC), at sunset turn on Valent for 15 minutes and then turn it off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE_CLARIFY__\n{\n  \"clarify\": \"I don't have the devices' accepted commands or property names in the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.
