{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a NuCore smart-home assistant. You convert the user\u2019s request into one or more NuCore routines based on the provided DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands \u0014 id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nNOTE: Device boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## Change of State (COS) \nA COS event occurs when a device property or status transitions from one value to another (e.g., OFF \u0014> ON, Closed \u0014> Open, 72\u00176F \u0014> 73\u00176F). It represents the moment of change, not the steady state.\n\n## Change of Control (COC):\nA COC event occurs when a device is physically controlled (e.g., tapping a wall switch, pressing a button, adjusting a knob), regardless of whether the state actually changes. It represents the act of human control, not just the resulting status.\n\n## When to Act\nWhen the user asks for automated and optimized behavior. Such as \"turn on the security system when I leave home\", or \"charge my car when prices are lowest\", or \"water the plants every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 9AM to 11AM but not when it's raining\", etc."}, {"role": "user", "content": "DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: Closet-D SW.4 - Heartbeat\nID: 55 90 9C 4\nParent: Closet-D - Door Sensor [ID: 55 90 9C 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]***Device***\nName: Closet-C - Door Sensor\nID: 55 AE 2C 1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]***Device***\nName: Closet-C SW.3 - Low Battery\nID: 55 AE 2C 3\nParent: Closet-C - Door Sensor [ID: 55 AE 2C 1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=51]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n    Beep [id=BEEP]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=100]\n    Write Changes [id=WDU]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Fast On [id=DFON]\n    Fast Off [id=DFOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: When the Closet-C door opens on weekdays between 09:00 and 17:00, query the Closet-C SW.3 low-battery sensor immediately to refresh its status."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "__BEGIN_NUCORE_ROUTINE__\n{\n  \"routine\": {\n    \"id\": 101,\n    \"name\": \"Weekday door-open refresh low-battery\",\n    \"parent\": 0,\n    \"comment\": \"Query low-battery sensor when Closet-C door opens during weekday business hours\",\n    \"if\": [\n      { \"==\": { \"device\": \"55 AE 2C 1\", \"status\": \"ST\", \"value\": 100, \"uom\": \"51\", \"precision\": 0 } },\n      { \"and\": 1 },\n      { \"weekly\": { \"days\": \"mon,tue,wed,thu,fri\", \"from\": { \"time\": \"09:00\", \"to\": { \"time\": \"17:00\" } } } }\n    ],\n    \"then\": [\n      { \"device\": \"55 AE 2C 3\", \"command\": \"QUERY\" }\n    ],\n    \"else\": [],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Trigger when Closet-C door status becomes On (door opened) and only during weekdays 09:00-17:00; action queries the Low Battery device to refresh its status so any alerting logic can act on fresh data.
