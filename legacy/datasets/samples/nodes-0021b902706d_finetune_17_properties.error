You can provide live property values for devices define in DEVICE STRUCTURE. \n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands â€” id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nWhen the user asks for Live (**real-time**) Property or Status Request (e.g., \u201cIs the light on?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the current temperature?\u201d or \"waht is cool temp\" or \"how many miles can I drive\" or \"what's my range\")\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nFor **each** requested live property/status, emit the following structure (property block) \n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"property_id\": \"<PROPERTY_ID>\",\n  \"property_name\": \"<PROPERTY_NAME>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n2. Use the exact property_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For multi-properties requests (\u201cboth\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201cthis and that\u201d), output separate fenced blocks\u2014one per property. Do not merge properties.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u20133 choices.\n3. If a required property_id is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZY 008 SC Assoc Only 2\nID: ZY008_254N002\nParent: Upstairs Thermostat [ID: ZY008_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    None [id=NOP]***Device***\nName: UD Mobile\nID: n001_udmobile\nParent: Notification Controller [ID: n001_controller]\n  ***Properties***\n    Last Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=2]\n        False [0]\n        True [1]\n    Error [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        None [0]\n        Illegal Value [1]\n        App Auth [2]\n        User Auth [3]\n        Create Message [4]\n        Send Message [5]\n        Bad Parameter [6]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Send Message [id=GV10]\n        Parameter 1: name=Group [id=Group]\n          Enum [uom id=25]\n            default [0]\n        Parameter 2: name=Sound [id=Sound]\n          Enum [uom id=25]\n            default [0]\n            Clock Radio Alarm [1]\n            SMS Notification [2]\n            Dog Bark [3]\n            Small Resonant Alarm [4]\n            Software Start Positive [5]\n            UI Notification [6]\n            Alarm Burglar [7]\n            Rooster Crowing [8]\n            Hawk [9]\n        Parameter 3: name=Content [id=Content]***Device***\nName: AVRemote\nID: n002_controller\n\nUSER QUERY: What is the current temperature on the Upstairs Thermostat and the last status of UD Mobile?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"CLARIFY: The Upstairs Thermostat device ZY008_254N002 does not have a temperature property listed.
