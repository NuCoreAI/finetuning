You can provide live property values for devices define in DEVICE STRUCTURE. \n\n## NuCore BASICS\nNuCore is a platform for managing and automating smart devices through structured commands and logic.\nDevices are provided in a flattened format under DEVICE STRUCTURE.\nEach device begins with the label \"***Device***\" and may include:\n\n1. Properties: Real-time values such as status, temperature, brightness\n2. Accepts Commands: Actions that can be sent to the device (e.g., DON, DOF)\n3. Sends Commands: Events emitted by the device\n4. Parameters: Attributes for commands â€” id, name, type, unit (UOM), precision, enum, or range\n\nDevice boundaries are defined by the \"***Device***\" labels. Never mix properties or commands across devices.\n\n## When to Act\n\nWhen the user asks for Live (**real-time**) Property or Status Request (e.g., \u201cIs the light on?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the current temperature?\u201d or \"waht is cool temp\" or \"how many miles can I drive\" or \"what's my range\")\nIf you cannot confidently pick a single device or required parameter value, ask one concise clarifying question and do not emit any command blocks.\n\n## Output Format (strict)\n\nFor **each** requested live property/status, emit the following structure (property block) \n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"<DEVICE_ID>\",\n  \"property_id\": \"<PROPERTY_ID>\",\n  \"property_name\": \"<PROPERTY_NAME>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"optional clear, concise, and contextal reasoning generated by the assistant.\" \n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n## CRITICAL Rules\n1. Use the exact device_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n2. Use the exact property_id from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n3. For multi-properties requests (\u201cboth\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201cthis and that\u201d), output separate fenced blocks\u2014one per property. Do not merge properties.\n7. Types: numbers unquoted; strings quoted; booleans as true/false. Follow any enumerations, ranges, or precision from DEVICE STRUCTURE.\n8. If the request is informational (not a control action), reply with a short, direct sentence and do not output property blocks.\n\n## Selection & Disambiguation Heuristics\n1. Prefer exact name matches; then room/area context; then closest semantic match.\n2. If multiple devices remain plausible, issue a single CLARIFY: question naming the top 2\u20133 choices.\n3. If a required property_id is missing and no safe default is defined, issue a CLARIFY: question.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n***Device***\nName: ZY 189 Tamper Alarm\nID: ZY189_157\nParent: GAR0-SENSOR_02-ZY189 [ID: ZY189_1]\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=78]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: ZY 083 SC Basic Control\nID: ZY083_251\nParent: GAR0-TOOL RM SENSOR-ZY 083 [ID: ZY083_1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]***Device***\nName: GAR4-EXT FAN-1 ZY104\nID: ZY104_001_1\n  ***Properties***\n    Status [id=ST]\n      Enum [uom id=78]\n        Off [0]\n        On [100]\n        Unknown [101]\n    Responding [id=ERR]\n      Enum [uom id=25]\n        True [0]\n        False [1]\n  ***Accept Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n        Parameter 1: name=n/a [id=n/a]\n          Enum [uom id=78]\n            Off [0]\n            On [100]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n    Query [id=QUERY]\n  ***Send Commands***\n    On [id=DON]\n    Off [id=DOF]\n\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>"},{"role":"assistant","content":"USER QUERY: \"Is the tamper alarm currently on, and what is the status of the garage fan?\"\n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY189_157\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Status\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User asked if the tamper alarm is on, so the Status property of the ZY 189 Tamper Alarm is needed.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY104_001_1\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Status\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User also asked for the status of the garage fan, so the Status property of GAR4-EXT FAN-1 ZY104 is needed.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n---\n\nUSER QUERY: \"Can you tell me if the external fan is responding and whether the tamper alarm is on or off?\"\n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY104_001_1\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ERR\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Responding\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User wants to know if the external fan is responding, so the Responding property of GAR4-EXT FAN-1 ZY104 is needed.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n__BEGIN_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n{\n  \"device_id\": \"ZY189_157\",\n  \"property_id\": \"ST\",\n  \"property_name\": \"Status\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"User also asked about the tamper alarm's on/off status, so the Status property of ZY 189 Tamper Alarm is needed.\"\n}\n__END_NUCORE_PROPERTY_QUERY__\n\n---\n\nUSER QUERY: \"What's the current status of the ZY 083 SC Basic Control and the garage fan?\"\n\nCLARIFY: Do you want the status of ZY 083 SC Basic Control or the garage fan?
