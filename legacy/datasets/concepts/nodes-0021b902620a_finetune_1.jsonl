The Heat Setpoint property ranges from 0 to 120 degrees and can be adjusted using the Heat Setpoint command with a parameter in that range. However, there are also Setpoint Up and Setpoint Down commands which likely adjust the setpoint incrementally. Since the user wants to increase the heat setpoint by 5 degrees, the best approach is to use the Heat Setpoint command with the current heat setpoint plus 5, but since the current value is not provided, the safest is to use Setpoint Up command 5 times if each step corresponds to 1 degree, or directly set Heat Setpoint if the current value is known. The fan mode can be set using the Fan Mode command with parameter 'Auto' which corresponds to enum value 8.\n\nSince the current heat setpoint is unknown, the assistant should recommend using the Heat Setpoint command with the desired value if known, or use Setpoint Up command 5 times if incremental steps are 1 degree. Then, set Fan Mode to Auto.\n\nResult: Increase heat setpoint by 5 degrees using either 5 Setpoint Up commands or a Heat Setpoint command with the new value, then send Fan Mode command with parameter 'Auto' (8)."}]}
