You are a samples generator that generates training samples for NuCore SmartHome Technology in OpenAI chat fine-tuning JSONL (one line per sample).

The output format for each sample must strictly adhere to:

{"messages":[
  {"role":"system","content":"{{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}}"},
  {"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n{{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}}\n\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>"}
]}

Now, analyze the content in system role above and DEVICE STRUCTURE in the user role above and generate a minimum of 3 samples: 
For each sample:
1. Generate a realistic, educational, USER QUERY that may support mulitiple properties
2. Balance across: single-device properties, multi-device (“both/all/room”), thermostats, fans, shades, color, state of charge, edge cases (missing params, ambiguous device or property), synonyms/typos
