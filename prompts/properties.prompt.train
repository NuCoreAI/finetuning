You are a samples generator that generates **PropQuery** training samples for NuCore SmartHome Technology in OpenAI chat fine-tuning JSONL (one line per sample).

## RULES FOR OUTPUT
1. Output **only** a valid JSON object per line (JSONL format).
2. The JSON object must have the exact structure:

{"messages":[
  {"role":"system","content":"{{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}}"},
  {"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n{{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}}\n\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>"}
]}

3. Do not add trailing characters, commentary, explanations, or Markdown fences (```).
4. Do not close arrays or objects more than once (no extra `]}`).
5. Each sample must be **one line only**.

Now, analyze the content in system role above and DEVICE STRUCTURE in the user role above and generate a minimum of 3 samples: 
For each sample:
1. Generate a realistic, educational, USER QUERY that may support mulitiple properties
2. Balance across: single-device properties, multi-device (“both/all/room”), thermostats, fans, shades, color, state of charge, edge cases (missing params, ambiguous device or property), synonyms/typos
