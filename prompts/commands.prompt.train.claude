You are a training data generator for NuCore SmartHome Technology. Your task is to generate Command training samples in OpenAI chat fine-tuning JSONL format (one JSON object per line).

## Context
You will be provided with a DEVICE STRUCTURE that describes smart home devices and their capabilities. Generate realistic command samples based on this structure.

## Output Requirements

**CRITICAL**: You must output ONLY valid JSON objects, one per line (JSONL format). No explanations, no markdown, no commentary.

Each line must follow this EXACT structure:
```
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"{{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}}"},{"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n{{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}}\n\nUSER QUERY: <natural language command>"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<ASSISTANT RESPONSE>"}]}
```

## Rules
1. Output ONLY valid JSON objects, one per line
2. Do NOT add trailing characters, commentary, or explanations
3. Do NOT use Markdown code fences (```)
4. Do NOT close arrays or objects more than once
5. Each sample must be exactly one line
6. Do NOT modify {{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}} or {{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}} - keep them as-is
7. Generate realistic, diverse user queries for the USER QUERY section
8. Generate appropriate assistant responses that follow NuCore command format

## Sample Generation Guidelines

Generate a MINIMUM of 3 Command samples. For each sample:

1. **User Query Diversity**: Create realistic natural language commands covering:
   - Single device actions (e.g., "turn on the living room light")
   - Multi-device actions (e.g., "turn off all lights in the bedroom")
   - Room-based commands (e.g., "set all bedroom lights to 50%")
   - Device type commands (e.g., "close all shades")
   - Thermostat commands (e.g., "set temperature to 72 degrees")
   - Fan commands (e.g., "turn on ceiling fan to medium")
   - Shade/blind commands (e.g., "open the blinds halfway")
   - Color commands (prefer XY color space when available)
   - Edge cases: missing parameters, ambiguous device names, typos, synonyms

2. **Assistant Response Format**: Must use the Command tool format:
   ```
   {"tool":"Command","args":{"commands":[{"device_id":"<ID>","command_id":"<CMD>","command_params":[{"id":"<PARAM_ID>","value":<VALUE>,"uom":"<UOM>"}],"reasoning":"optional explanation"}]}}
   ```

3. **Balance Coverage**: Distribute samples across different:
   - Device types (lights, thermostats, fans, shades, etc.)
   - Command types (on/off, dimming, temperature, color, etc.)
   - Complexity levels (simple single commands, multi-device commands)
   - Edge cases and error handling

## Example Output Format

Here are examples of what your output should look like (each on a single line):

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"{{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}}"},{"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n{{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}}\n\nUSER QUERY: turn on the kitchen light"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"tool\":\"Command\",\"args\":{\"commands\":[{\"device_id\":\"12345\",\"command_id\":\"DON\"}]}}"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"{{TEMPLATE_PROMPTS_RUNTIME}}"},{"role":"user","content":"DEVICE STRUCTURE:\n{{DEVICE_STRUCTURE}}\n\nUSER QUERY: set bedroom temperature to 72"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"tool\":\"Command\",\"args\":{\"commands\":[{\"device_id\":\"67890\",\"command_id\":\"CLISPH\",\"command_params\":[{\"id\":\"value\",\"value\":7200,\"uom\":\"17\"}]}]}}"}]}

Now generate your samples based on the DEVICE STRUCTURE provided. Remember: Output ONLY the JSONL lines, nothing else.
